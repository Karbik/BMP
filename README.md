# WHAT IS THIS? 

Demo can be found [here](https://www.karbik.eu/projects/bmp)

BMP is a toy? experiment? based on Craig Reynolds's boids. He envisioned boids as "creatures" modelled to approximate flocking behaviour by following three simple rules:
* Separation - steer to avoid crowding local flockmates
* Alignment - steer towards the average heading of local flockmates
* Cohesion - steer to move toward the average position of local flockmates
